# ðŸ†’ Install AFFiNE with Docker

This guide assumes you already have an environment setup running docker.

Currently there are two main versions:
1) AFFiNE Alpha - The latest version in active development. `affine-self-hosted:latest`
1) AFFiNE Pre-Alpha - Previous release which is no longer developed, but offers different functionality. `affine-self-hosted:pre-alpha`

Simply swap out the Docker image for which version you require, the following instructions default to the latest image. 

### Installing AFFiNE using Docker

* Pull the latest AFFiNE image. This may take some time depending on your network connection.

```
docker pull ghcr.io/toeverything/affine-self-hosted:latest
```

Ensure this step is completed successfully before continuing (you can rerun this command if you are unsure).

* Next we will run the AFFiNE project in Docker.

```
docker run -it --name affine -d -v YOUR_PATH:/app/data -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/toeverything/affine-self-hosted:latest
```

Tips:

`--name` Optional - this makes it convenient for using and interacting with your Docker container - such as `docker restart affine`.
`-v` Optional - allows you to mount your data outside of Docker to your local machine. Remember to set `YOUR_PATH` to the directory of your choice.
`-p` Required - this sets the port for where AFFiNE is running and listening, we use the default 3000 if you need to change this only change the first number e.g. `[YOUR_PORT]:3000`
Finally, the image id is the version of AFFiNE you wish to deploy. Following this guide, it would be the same as the previous step - so `ghcr.io/toeverything/affine-self-hosted:latest`

* You can confirm that AFFiNE is running successfully by using the command

```
docker ps
```

This command shows a list of running containers - in the list you should be able to find AFFiNE.

* Now you can access AFFiNE from your browser via:
  * If you are running Docker on your local machine and using the default settings you can access via port 3000 through localhost: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
  * Otherwise you will need to know the {IP} of the machine using Docker and the {PORT} that AFFiNE is using.
  * Bear in mind that some features require a secure environment to work, which means https and wss connections through a reverse proxy setup. For more support you may wish to find our community page: [AFFiNE Community]('https://community.affine.pro')
